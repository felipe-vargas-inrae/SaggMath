# Meteo France Preprocessing

This project aims at pre-processing datasets from MeteoNet, a meteorological dataset developed and made available by METEO FRANCE, the French national meteorological service (https://meteonet.umr-cnrm.fr/).  
These datasets are in csv format and are transformed into RDF.

The Dataset is licenced by METEO FRANCE under Etalab Open Licence 2.0.
